# Calculator Kata

A calculator kata implemented in vanilla JS/CSS/HTML

### Still to do
- handle excessively long display values
- Improve styling and usablility
- I would like to improve the style of the code.  There is a lot of direct state mutation scattered throughout the code.  It does not adhere too well to "functional core, imperative shell".  On the other hand, would that be over engineering for such a small code base?
